## Websocket TODO

A simple example of a TODO app currently utilized at my company for tracking and assigning tasks among team members. Initially, we utilized a Docker image deployed on an Azure Container App. However, over time, we opted to transition to a Raspberry Pi as the WebSocket server. Now, users of the app only require the 'client.js' and 'index.html' files on their devices connected to the internal network to communicate with the WebSocket server and utilize the application.
